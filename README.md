# SVGExportTest

you can see it working [here](https://dattasaurabh82.github.io/SVGExportTest/)

It is a small p5Js experiment used to make patterns for stippling out of images and export them as svgs. 

~~used [**p5.js-SVG**]extensively~~

#####To install the dependencies from `package.json` :
`
npm install 
`
#####To run the server with out restarting (hoping the nodemon package have installed in your mac. 
`
nodemon server.js
`
if nodemon doesn't get installed try: 
`npm install nodemon -g --save`
Although it is not that necessary. you can just do `node server.js` .. but then you've to restart it again and again..
